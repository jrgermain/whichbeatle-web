## My whichbeatle program, ported to html/css/js

*If you haven't checked it out yet, I'd recommend going over to [jrgermain/whichbeatle](https://github.com/jrgermain/whichbeatle) for some context.*

This webpage will find the writer, singer, and/or album appearances of any Beatles song. Originally, I made a command-line Java program, but I figured a website would be more user-friendly (and a great first webdev project). So now I'm bringing whichbeatle to the masses!

## The making of whichbeatle.com

My philosophy for this port of whichbeatle was to avoid over-engineering and make the web version clean and javascript-y instead of retrofitting my old code. This basically led to a complete re-write, which involved replacing my SQLite database with a simple js array and avoiding complex libraries and dependencies.

As I've learned new things, I've come back to this project to add new features like native dark mode, responsive design, and embedded youtube videos.
