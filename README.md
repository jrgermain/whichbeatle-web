# Which Beatle?

Find info about Beatles songs, listen to your favorites, and discover new ones!

## Background

Years back, I created a command-line Java program ([jrgermain/whichbeatle](https://github.com/jrgermain/whichbeatle)) that let the user query information about Beatles songs from a SQLite database.

Since then, I developed an interest in web development, so I created a web version. Over the years, I've revisited the project to make occasional updates like the following:

- A dark theme that is automatically used when the user is using dark mode on their device
- [Responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)
- Embedded YouTube videos for the songs the user looks up
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
- GitHub Actions integration
- Modern, fun technologies like TypeScript and Vite
